# Production environment variables for GitHub Pages deployment
# IMPORTANT: Replace this URL with your actual deployed backend API URL
# For now, using localhost (you'll need to update this when backend is deployed)

# Option 1: If backend is deployed (recommended)
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com/api

# Option 2: For testing GitHub Pages without backend (will cause API errors)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# When you deploy your backend to Heroku, Render, Railway, or similar service,
# uncomment and update the URL above with your actual backend URL
